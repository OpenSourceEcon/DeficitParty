# Data, code, and HTML/JavaScript dynamic images of U.S. debt and deficits
This repository contains data, code, and dynamic visualizations of U.S. deficits over time by political party prevalence in both the White House and U.S. Congress. The data visualizations show deficits by party control of the U.S. Congress. All dynamic visualizations in this repository were created in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language using the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) visualization library.

The "DeficitParty" name has a double meaning. First, this repository represents a coding party of deficit and debt dynamic data visualization. This should be a nice tutorial for using Bokeh to richly display data for description and exploration. The second and more literal significance of the repository name "DeficitParty" is that these visualizations show government debt held by the public and the deficit components that contributed to those debts by party control of the White House and U.S. Congress.

## How to open, view, and manipulate dynamic visualizations
Each dynamic visualization in this repository is an HTML file that includes JavaScript code for the visualizations in the [`/images`](images/) folder. The HTML files with JavaScript visualization code were created by [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts and modules that used the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) visualization library. These HTML file dynamic visualizations can be viewed in any web browser that renders HTML files.

To view these files, you can either download them directly from this repository or you can clone this repository to your local machine. Both of these options are available from the green "`Code`" button near the upper-right side of the [repository main page](https://github.com/OpenSourceEcon/DeficitParty).

## Description of each dynamic visualization
Give a description of each dynamic visualization in the images folder, what script generates it, and how to interpret it. Include a screen shot of the image.
